# Discussion

## Key results

In this large cohort study emulating a target trial mirroring the ARISTOTLE
study, I hypothesized that obesity, using BMI as a proxy, would be an
effect modifier of the effectiveness and safety of apixaban compared to
warfarin in non-valvular atrial fibrillation patients. After emulating the target trial using observational data from the CPRD Aurum linked to HES APC and ONS, my hypothesis was not confirmed. In both minimally and fully adjusted models, hypothesis testing for statistical interaction did not show evidence of effect modification apart from systemic embolism (interaction-*p*: 0.047 in the fully adjusted model).

Moreover, I found that the average treatment effect for apixaban, compared to warfarin, was similar in overweight and obese patients to those with a healthy weight in terms of effectiveness and safety outcomes in the study.

In the analysis, apixaban was non-inferior to warfarin in stroke/SE
prevention, superior in rates of major bleeding events, and did not
differ in death from any cause. For the individual components of the
composite primary endpoint, apixaban was non-inferior in ischemic stroke in overweight and obese but not in normal weight, while being inferior in
hemorrhagic stroke in all BMI groups. Events of SE were scarce, resulting in very wide 95% CIs and hindering any meaningful interpretations of the results. The results were robust in sensitivity analyses as none meaningfully deviated from the main analysis. 

The similar treatments response across BMI groups in the study was contrary to previous suggestions in the literature that obesity plays a major role in treatment effects of anticoagulants^[@fenderDirectOralAnticoagulation2021; @sebaalyDirectOralAnticoagulants2020]^. 

The effect modification seen in systemic embolism alone was also surprising but based on few events and, therefore, can largely arise due to chance alone with no meaningful interpretation. This also did not hold in the sensitivity analysis restricted to those with ≤ 3 years of BMI records.

## Interpretation

The BMI stratified analysis in this study was similar to the
reported results from the ARISTOTLE
trial, which investigated the effects in the overall groups rather than within BMI groups^[@grangerApixabanWarfarinPatients2011]^. In ARISTOTLE, apixaban
was found to be superior to warfarin in both composite of Stroke/SE (HR 0.79; 95% CI: 0.66, 0.95) and major bleeding (HR 0.69; 95% CI: 0.60, 0.80). The findings in this study were also consistent with the results of the recent study by Deitelzweig *et al.*(2022) in the United States, which investigated the effects across BMI groups and showed similar conclusions to my study^[@deitelzweigEffectivenessSafetyApixaban2022]^. Another US-based study by Deitelzweig *et al.*(2020) investigated the effects in the obese population only and had similar results to the obese group in my study^[@deitelzweigEffectivenessSafetyOral2020]^.

In my study, and similarly, in both US-based cohort studies, the main difference from ARISTOTLE was the lack of superiority for the primary effectiveness outcome (stroke/SE). There could be multiple
reasons for such a difference in my study. One important reason for me was the differential follow-up between the two groups with a large number of administrative censoring in the apixaban arm. This could have been investigated by inverse probability censoring weighting to assess the possible impact of bias on study estimates but would require extensive work to avoid model misspecification^[@hernanmaCausalInferenceWhat2020]^. 

Furthermore, I cannot rule out the possibility of unmeasured confounding. Despite accounting for several confounders in the analysis, there could be psychological and personal factors
affecting the choice of prescribed treatment and the risk of the outcome. As the results of ARISTOTLE were published before this study's start date and clinical trials usually change the clinical practice, it is possible that treatment choice relied on non-measurable behaviors (e.g., more willingness to comply with INR monitoring despite the availability of other effective treatment). 

Besides, this could arise due to deviations from ARISTOTLE protocol, such as lack of blinding or differences in warfarin monitoring. 
In ARISTOTLE, nonetheless, apixaban was not superior to warfarin in ischemic stroke. In my analysis, the number of ischemic
stroke events was, in each BMI group, twice the overall number in ARISTOTLE. This could have driven the composite endpoint towards the null. 

In terms of major bleeding, the study agreed with previous findings.
Apixaban appeared to be superior to warfarin in major bleeding events, with the effect being consistent across BMI groups. The rate of major bleeding was similar to that reported in ARISTOTLE. However, it was much lower than the two US cohort studies, especially in warfarin users. When comparing event rates in the warfarin arm (per 100 person-years), my study had an event rate of 2.42 and 2.08 in normal weight and overweight groups, respectively, compared to a rate of 10.1 in the non-obese group (the equivalent group) in Deitelzweig *et al.* (2022)^[@deitelzweigEffectivenessSafetyApixaban2022]^. Among the obese group, my study found an event rate (per 100-person years) of 2.37 compared to 6.8 and 7.6 in Deitelzweig *et al.* (2020)^[@deitelzweigEffectivenessSafetyOral2020]^ and Deitelzweig *et al.* (2022)^[@deitelzweigEffectivenessSafetyApixaban2022]^, respectively. 

This could indicate regional differences in the quality of warfarin monitoring. It could be that warfarin is better controlled in UK practices, but such comparison is unattainable as none of the studies reported the time in therapeutic range for warfarin. 

There could be other differences among study populations. For example, my study used data from a universally accessed health care system. In contrast, the US-based studies were mainly based on data from the Medicare database and selected insurance claims. Therefore, these populations could be systematically different as those with access to these health care facilities in the US might not represent the general population.

Another important explanation is the under-ascertainment of major bleeding events in my study. While the data source (i.e., HES APC) is of high validity in ascertaining the events^[@mcdonaldUnderrecordingHospitalBleeding2018]^, my study had slightly different clinical codes compared to Deitelzweig *et al.* (2020)^[@deitelzweigEffectivenessSafetyOral2020]^, but this is not known for Deitelzweig *et al.* (2022)^[@deitelzweigEffectivenessSafetyApixaban2022]^ as no codes were reported. The extent to which this can explain between-study differences is not yet known. However, it is unlikely to be the sole reason, considering the less extreme differences in bleeding rates in the apixaban arm. Lastly, my study excluded patients with low hemoglobin levels, which could have contributed to the lower event rate.

The follow-up duration in this study was considerably longer than the one by Deitelzweig *et al.* (2020)^[@deitelzweigEffectivenessSafetyOral2020]^. The median follow-up in my study was 1.53 years and 4 years in apixaban and warfarin arms, respectively, while ranging from 6-8 months in Deitelzweig *et al.* (2020). Deitelzweig *et al.* (2022) did not report a duration of follow-up in the study.

My study also employed a slightly different causal contrast compared to the other studies. This study was mainly concerned with the effect of prescribing either apixaban or warfarin (i.e., ITT) on the rates of Stroke/SE and, thus, did not censor for treatment switching except for safety. 

## Strengths and limitations
The greatest strength of this study is its use of a validated and representative routinely collected primary care data source with linkage to secondary care, which improved the completeness of ascertaining the study outcomes. I used a target trial design and restricted the enrollment to incident users of treatments as tools to minimize bias. The study also collected data and accounted for multiple confounding factors, including demographic, prognostic, social, lifestyle, and socioeconomic factors, including both individual level and practice level deprivation indices. I also included a trial-eligible population allowing a better comparison with the reference RCT using observational data.

Moreover, another strength was the ability to look at BMI groups with acceptable precision. The large sample size (> 50,000 participants) could be looked at from two perspectives. Although this is not largely distinguished in the literature, this study focused on effect modification rather than interaction^[@vanderweeleDistinctionInteractionEffect2009]^. That is, what is the average treatment effect within BMI strata rather than, for example, what is the joint effect of anticoagulation and weight loss (i.e., interaction effect). If one would consider the first case, the study was well powered. However, to detect an interaction effect, a much larger sample size is needed, which would, probably, render my study underpowered^[@hsiehOverviewVarianceInflation2003]^. 

However, the study has multiple limitations. I had a large proportion of patients being censored with incomplete follow-up. This resulted in more warfarin patients having a complete follow-up compared to those on apixaban leading to differential follow-up, which can be a source of selection bias in the study^[@hernanmaCausalInferenceWhat2020]^. A more comparable approach would have been to split the study into two periods: a recruitment period followed by a follow-up period to allow time for follow-up of the last recruited patient, as in RCTs. This was not feasible in my study since apixaban prescription increased dramatically during the last three years of the study^[@ApixabanBNFCode]^. 

Furthermore, the study used an intention-to-treat (ITT) approach but did not measure treatment compliance, which can affect study estimates^[@hernanIntentionTreatComparative2012]^. Lower compliance can attenuate differences between treatments or, in extreme cases, favor one treatment over another. It is more sensible to assume that compliance would be mainly affected in the warfarin arm due to continuous monitoring, which, if true, would make warfarin effects underestimated. Another drawback of the ITT is the assumption that patients who started a medication continued on the same medication throughout the study, which might be erroneous as some people might switch treatment. It is, therefore, possible that some patients on warfarin switched to apixaban, but their time at risk was attributed to warfarin as the consumption of apixaban increased steadily after ARISTOTLE. This might attenuate any differences between treatments. An analysis using time-varying treatments would have been a useful causal contrast here. This, however, will need data on time-varying confounders to account for treatment-confounder feedback. Therefore, the effects in this study can be considered the effect of prescribing apixaban or warfarin at baseline rather than the effect of treatment^[@hernanIntentionTreatComparative2012;@hernanmaCausalInferenceWhat2020]^. 

I also did not capture treatment initiation at secondary care, which can lead to inaccuracy in ascertaining the index date and, therefore, underestimation of the actual time at risk. Although this can be mainly non-differential between treatments, patients may be more likely to start apixaban in secondary care considering the lower need for monitoring. If true, this could attenuate the effects of apixaban by overestimating the actual rate. 

I assumed that the measured confounders were sufficient to block any backdoor paths (i.e., I have captured all the reasons related to treatment initiation and outcome). However, this can hardly resemble the truth, either due to residual or unmeasured confounding. Confounders can be time-varying while my study collected data at baseline only or, as previously mentioned, other psychological and unmeasured factors (e.g., willingness to comply with INR monitoring in more active patients) can affect the choice of treatment and outcome. A quantitative bias analysis indicated that an unmeasured confounder moderately associated with the exposure and outcome can largely affect the study estimates. The assumptions depicted in DAGs were based on a narrative review, and a different set of scenarios might be valid. It also does not depict measurement error to minimize complexity. 

The effect modifier, BMI, can be subjected to measurement error with the categorization of BMI introducing further misclassification^[@groenwoldAdjustmentContinuousConfounders2013]^. Although I have repeated the analysis restricting BMI observations to ≤3 years without a meaningful difference, BMI can rapidly change with time. Especially if this coincides with a diagnosis of NVAF, for which increased body weight is a major risk factor to sustain^[@lavieObesityAtrialFibrillation2017a]^. I cannot also preclude effect modification on additive scales, which would have been of more interest to public health decisions but would require the use of additive hazard models^[@rodAdditiveInteractionSurvival2012]^. 

In addition, data on important lifestyle confounders (e.g., alcohol and smoking) could have been impacted by social desirability bias. This will result in the under-reporting of extreme categories and contribute to residual confounding, which is likely non-differential with the study estimate likely to be between the unadjusted and true adjusted results. Residual confounding can also impact data on NSAIDs and antacids as both are available over-the-counter.

I also acknowledge that my data comes from routine clinical care, which may lead to a different rate of contact with the healthcare system during the follow-up across groups. This can lead to, for example, patients having less controlled hypertension or diabetes which would increase the risk of the outcome and result in residual confounding. This can lead to underestimation of apixaban effects if those on warfarin have more contact with their GP due to the needed monitoring for warfarin. Other limitations in the study included the joint analysis of the 5 mg and 2.5 mg groups in the apixaban arm.

## Generalizability

How generalizable the results are to the general population is an important consideration. My study used electronic health records from universally accessed databases, which have been found to be representative of the UK population^[@bhaskaranRepresentativenessOptimalUse2013; @herrettDataResourceProfile2015]^. However, the data linkage in my study restricted the inclusion to patients living in England. I also included a trial-eligible population while those excluded might be systematically different. Therefore, the findings of this research can only be extrapolated to those with similar characteristics to those included in the study. Extrapolation to other countries might also be limited as different countries might have differences in the quality of warfarin monitoring.


## Implications for practice and future research 

The study objective was to assess the effectiveness and safety of apixaban across BMI groups. I did that by looking at stratum-specific hazard ratios for BMI groups. I believe that the results provide evidence of comparative treatment effects between apixaban and warfarin in the investigated BMI groups. Furthermore, my results were similar to the other studies investigating either the overall or BMI-stratum-specific effects of treatments. This provides robust data for evidence-based decisions for both patients and health practitioners regarding treatment choice. This could be more valuable also in times of pandemics where many patients might not be able to maintain the continuous monitoring for warfarin due to their frailty as NVAF patients or where many under-resourced health care systems might not have the capability for it. 

This research showed comparable effectiveness and safety of apixaban to warfarin in obese and non-obese populations; there are, however, remaining unanswered questions that can be addressed by the following: 

1- A future study can be done while extending the recruitment to non-eligible populations to ARISTOTLE (e.g., those at increased bleeding risk). This can be an important tool for generalizing the results to excluded populations. 

2- This study compared one drug of the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), apixaban, to warfarin. Therefore, another study can be conducted to compare either other DOACs to warfarin and/or to use observational data for a within-class comparison of different DOACs. These can provide evidence to inform which DOAC should be prioritized in clinical practice. 

3- A future study can also ensure sufficient power to assess patients with extreme body weights by pooling results from both CPRD Aurum and CPRD gold databases or including trial ineligible populations when validated.  

## Conclusions 

In conclusion, after emulating the target trial, BMI, as a proxy for obesity, was not an effect modifier of the effectiveness and safety of apixaban compared to warfarin. The effects of the two treatments in the study were similar in obese and overweight patients to normal weight patients across all study outcomes. This provides reassurance about the use of apixaban in these patient populations. However, future research is needed to investigate the generalizability of the results, compare the different available direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), and assess the effect in extremely obese patients.
